# Contributing to Todo List App Backend

Welcome to the Todo List App Backend contributing guide! We appreciate your interest in contributing and are excited to collaborate with you on improving the backend functionality of our application.

## Communication Before Changes

Before making any significant changes or enhancements, please open an issue in the GitHub repository to discuss your ideas or concerns with the project maintainers. This dialogue can help avoid duplicated efforts and ensure that your changes align with the project's goals.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies are removed or included appropriately in your pull request. Only submit code necessary for the proposed change.

2. **Documentation**: Update the `README.md` to reflect any changes in the project's functionality. This includes new environment variables, ports, file locations, and parameters.

3. **Versioning**: Increment the version numbers in any example files and the `README.md` to represent the new version that your Pull Request will introduce. We follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](http://semver.org/).

4. **Peer Review**: Once you submit your pull request, at least two other project contributors must review and approve your changes. If you don't have merging permissions, one of the reviewers with such permissions can merge the pull request for you.
